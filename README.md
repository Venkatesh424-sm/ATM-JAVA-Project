# ATM-Simulation
Built a Java ATM Simulation system with user registration, secure login, and core banking modules like balance check, deposit, and withdrawal. Implemented encapsulation, custom exceptions for invalid login and negative amounts, and a menu-driven interface to enhance security, validation, and user experience in a console-based application.
